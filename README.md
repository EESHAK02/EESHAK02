## Hello, I'm Eesha

### Graduate Student at Carnegie Mellon University
My research focuses on applying machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision across trajectory modeling, anomaly detection and LLM-based agentic explainer systems. 

Currently seeking full-time opportunities in AI/ML/Data Science domains - open to exploring diverse industries/application areas!

## Featured Projects
- **Bacterial Motility Analysis** - Streamlit platform for tracking & classifying trajectories + GAN based trajectory generation augmenting data for downstream ML Classifier 
- **TEP Fault Detection** - CNN + Transformer, Convolutional Autoencoders for identifying anomalies in a time-series process dataset (TEP Dataset) - [Published as a preprint](https://chemrxiv.org/doi/full/10.26434/chemrxiv.10001628/v1)
- **Fraud Detection Agent** - ML models + adversarial attacks + LLM-based agent to explain why a transaction has been flagged as a fraud
- **RetroTrader** - Leveraging DistilBERT and FinBERT for summary + sentiment analysis of financial news wrapped in a CRT-style UI on Streamlit
